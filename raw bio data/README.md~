# CellRep2020

Data and code for Reker et al Cell Rep 2020.

#### /Raw bio data
contains raw experimental data of the *in vitro*, *ex vivo*, *in vivo* validations.

#### /chembl22
contains raw chembl22 data for model training. in this repository we only include P-gp data as a single example to run prediction code.
Please note that this data is added for reproducibility, but we encourage users
to curate updated versions of ChEMBL to ensure training models on 
larger and improved data. Cf. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/

#### prediction.py
Python code to run predictions of GRAS/IIG bioactivities
use a respective target ID to train a specific model
For example, 
> python prediction.py 11398
will run predictions for P-glycoprotein and store
prediction results in a seperate TSV file

#### gras_iig.tsv
SMILES structures of GRAS/IIG compounds used in predictions

#### background.tsv
SMILES structures of molecular weight-matched background library of random chemicals

#### test_data.tsv
known IC50/Ki activities of GRAS/IIG compounds from ChEMBL22, serves as validation data for model optimization/selection
